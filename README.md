# crisprSNF UNDER CONSTRUCTION
crisprSNF is a bioinformatic pipeline used to analyse CRISPR-Cas9 screen from either genome-wide or targeted pooled gRNA.
This pipeline is under construction using NEXFLOW and inspired by the nf-core good practice workslow.
Some of the routinary steps are taken from the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline.
